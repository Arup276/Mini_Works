# What is YOLO-V3?
YOLO ,or You Only Look Once is a object detion algoritham. iT's the most accurate real time object detection algorithm.
If want to more about YOLO-V3 then you check [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/yolo-v3-object-detection-53fb7d3bfe6b).



#### So recently i was playing with yolo-v3 (i was also do little bit yolo-v2) and since now a days PUBG moblie is very famous to i tried this yolo on pubg.Though i don't get high accuracy but it's ok because i was trained this model just around 300 hundred of images(i was too much excited about that) but now i know little about the procedure so again i will do with more images.





#### If you want to use my model then follow the steps ,i make it very simple because i was (still) very complicated for me so i try to break is down. Here Extra you have nothing to do extra.So jump right into it...



# How You Can Use My model?
